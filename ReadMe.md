# LessHealing

A Hollow Knight mod that adds toggleable options that remove various healing methods from the game.

## Options include:
-  **Bench healing**: The healing received when a player sits on a bench
-  **Focus healing**: The healing received after a player successfully completes a focus
-  **Hotspring healing**: The healing received after a player remains within a hotspring for a time
-  **Retain health**: The option to keep the same health after exiting a save when reentering the game (requires bench healing to be disabled for an effect)
